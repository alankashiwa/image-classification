# Project: Image Classification
The second project of [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com) **Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation**

Classify images of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects using a convolutional neural network. Techniques like nomralization, one-hot encoding, and max pool layer are applied in the model building.
